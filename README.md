# General Information
Using SqlAlchemy, analyzed and explored the climate data for Hawaii. I retrieved the precipitation data for the previous 12 months, filtered the stations for the most active and completed a query for the previous 12 months temperature observations for the most active station. In addition, I plotted the precipitation and temperature data. Afterwards, I have used Flask API to create a climate app of the queries.
